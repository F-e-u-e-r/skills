"""Observation/persistence primitive for the skill-vetting advisory hook.

This module owns everything that touches the filesystem for
`hooks/skill-vetting-advisory.py`: root enumeration (`scan_root`), the
whole-tree snapshot, the canonical digest encoding, and the hardened baseline
load/store. Its LIBRARY core is policy-free (it decides no verdicts); the CLI
adds a thin verdict-recording convenience (`record`/`status`) so the
skill-vetting skill's §3 binding is executable - for a candidate whose own name
passes the display gate. For a hostile-named one it is NOT: `digest` reports
`badname` for every addressing form the procedure sanctions (one limit, in §3:
a candidate that is ITSELF a symlink and entered with `cd` cannot be recovered
by name from inside the process - `.` is already the resolved target - so that
spelling is refused rather than digested), and `record` would need that name on a
command line, which §3 forbids. Such a candidate gets a prose BLOCK and no
digest binding; closing that is design item D1. The hook itself is a thin
dispatcher and contains no filesystem-walking logic of its own. Design record:
`evidence/reviews/2026-07-25-skill-vetting-snapshot-threat-model.md` (threat model,
goals G1-G6, invariants I1-I11). A deliberate naming deviation: this file uses
an underscore (not the hooks/ hyphen convention) because the hook imports it
as a Python module; install it NEXT TO the hook (same directory).

Contract highlights (the tests in hooks/test-skill_snapshot.py hold each):

- INJECTIVE ENCODING (I1): the manifest serializes as a length-prefixed binary
  stream (fixed header + schema AND policy versions + sorted entries, with the
  path and the payload length-prefixed and the kind tag written raw as a FIXED
  ONE-BYTE tag - injectivity holds because the tag is fixed-width, NOT because
  it is framed). There are no delimiter characters to collide with path
  or symlink-target bytes, so two distinct MANIFESTS cannot share a digest. That
  is a statement about the encoder, not about the world: two trees the scanner
  refuses to observe in detail (say, two different unopenable things) can share
  a manifest and therefore a digest - they are both anomalies and both always
  advise.
- FD-VERIFIED OBSERVATION (I2): type from lstat, re-verified by fstat on an fd
  opened O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK|O_CLOEXEC (O_NONBLOCK so a planted
  FIFO cannot hang the open); only regular files are hashed, from that fd.
  Symlinks record raw target bytes and are ANOMALIES - their referent can
  change outside the tree, so they can never be certified unchanged.
  Directories are entries too (empty-dir adds/removes change the digest).
- FAIL CLOSED (G2/I5): anything not fully observable - unreadable file/dir,
  oversize file, entry/byte budget breach, structural depth/fanout refusal,
  symlink, special file (FIFO/socket/device) - is an ANOMALY with a stable
  reason code. A hostile or undecodable name is an anomaly only for a TOP-LEVEL
  candidate (the name that gets displayed); nested names are not gated, because
  they are never echoed and their bytes are already bound into the digest. An anomalous snapshot never counts as "unchanged".
- HARDENED BASELINE I/O (I6): read via O_NOFOLLOW with a size cap and strict
  schema/shape validation (any deviation -> "corrupt", a visible state, never
  a silent re-baseline); write via same-directory mkstemp(0600) + os.replace
  into a 0700, caller-owned, non-group/world-writable directory; a symlinked
  baseline path or untrusted directory refuses the write.
- WHAT THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE: no resistance to same-privilege tampering
  (the baseline is NOT tamper-evident - local code with your authority can
  rewrite it, the skills, or this file); no malice detection (the
  skill-vetting skill's full read is the actual check); no observation of
  roots outside the watched set; TOCTOU perfection is out of scope - every
  hash is computed from the exact bytes read off an opened fd, so races
  degrade to an extra advisory next run, not a silent miss.

CLI (used by the skill-vetting skill's verdict procedure, §3):
  python3 skill_snapshot.py digest <dir>            # canonical digest + anomalies (exit 3 if anomalous)
  python3 skill_snapshot.py record --scope <global|proj:PATH> --name <name> \
      --dir <dir> --verdict <SAFE-TO-PROPOSE|SUSPECT|BLOCK>   # bind a verdict to the exact snapshot
  python3 skill_snapshot.py status                  # list baseline entries and vetting statuses

Python 3.8+, stdlib only. POSIX (macOS/Linux); Windows is untested and out of
scope for the O_NOFOLLOW/ownership checks.

    `partial` is True when the digest describes the SCAN STATE rather than the
    tree (a resource-budget short-circuit): a caller must never store it as that
    skill's digest, which is what I9 hangs on. The other keys are as follows,
    where
    anomalies is a list of (reason, rel_path_bytes) with stable reason codes:
    unreadable / oversize / budget / depth / fanout / symlink / special / root.
    NOT `badname`: since round 6 a NESTED name is never display-gated (its bytes
    are already bound into the digest and it is never echoed), so this function
    cannot produce that reason. A TOP-LEVEL candidate name is still gated, by
    the CLI and hook wrappers, not here.
    Anomalies are also manifest entries where they REPLACE an observation, so
    an anomaly appearing or healing changes the digest; comparison callers
    must treat ANY anomaly as "anomalous" regardless of digest equality (I5).

    Directory descent goes ONLY through O_NOFOLLOW-verified directory fds, so a
    directory swapped for a symlink mid-scan is never traversed as the original
    tree (it becomes an anomaly). Peak concurrently-open dir fds are bounded by
    MAX_OPEN_DIRS pending fds plus the one currently being scanned - so the
    peak DESCRIPTOR count is MAX_OPEN_DIRS plus a small constant (the directory
    being scanned, the fd os.scandir dups for its iterator, and at most one
    regular-file fd), and `scan_root` adds its own root fd and that fd's dup.
    Bounded by a constant, never O(width) - which is the property that matters;
    the cap is not the peak, and no exact total is claimed here because it
    depends on CPython dup'ing for fdopendir. `budget` may be a shared dict to bound work across many
    candidates in one run; when omitted, a per-candidate budget is used. A

    A dot spelling does not name anything. To gate the candidate's NAME the
    caller has to recover it, and the only way to recover it is to resolve the
    path - which follows symlinks, which is precisely how a planted link gets
    its target's harmless name gated in place of its own. So resolution is
    permitted ONLY where independent evidence says no link was followed at the
    final component, and $PWD is the only such evidence that exists.

    That makes the permitted case narrow and everything else a refusal:

        resolve  when $PWD IS the candidate and $PWD is not itself a symlink
        REFUSE   otherwise

    Passes 13 and 14 each fixed one spelling and left the shape open; the
    round-8 cross-model gate then reproduced three more ways through it, two of
    which need no `cd` at all (all against a planted
    `skills/<hostile> -> elsewhere/benign`):

    - `..` in any form. The old guard compared realpath($PWD) to realpath(raw);
      for `..` those are the child and the parent, so they are NEVER equal and
      the refusal could not fire whatever the candidate was. `digest
      <link>/sub/..` then returned exit 0 with an EMPTY anomaly list where the
      full path returns exit 3 with `symlink` + `badname`, and `record` bound
      SAFE-TO-PROPOSE under name_key(b"benign") - a slot the hook never looks
      at, leaving the trojan with no verdict at all and an unread name marked
      safe. Two lenses reported this independently.
    - `<link>/sub/../.` and `<link>/sub/.././`. _strip_trailing removes the
      trailing `/.`, so these arrive here as `..` spellings; they were reported
      as a `..` defect and are not - they are `.` spellings that reach the same
      laundering, which is why "refuse `..`" (the remedy both lenses proposed)
      would have closed one hole and left two.
    - $PWD unset. `cd <link> && digest .` from a bare subprocess resolved to the
      target and returned exit 0. This was DOCUMENTED as a limitation rather
      than treated as a hole; a documented laundering path is still a laundering
      path, and failing closed costs nothing the contract promised.

    Ancestor symlinks stay ordinary: on macOS /tmp -> /private/tmp and
    /var -> /private/var, so testing anything but the FINAL component would
    refuse most real working directories. islink($PWD) tests arrival at the
    candidate itself, not the route to it.

    A refusal is not a dead end - the message names the way through, and it is
    the same one SKILL.md §3 already prescribes: address the candidate by a path
    whose last component is its own name. D1's --root/--select removes the dot
    spelling from the interface entirely."""
