"""Claude Code SessionStart hook: a PURE-ADVISORY tripwire for unvetted or
changed third-party skills. Companion to the `skill-vetting` skill; enforces
nothing. THIN BY DESIGN: every filesystem observation and every baseline
read/write lives in the sibling module `hooks/skill_snapshot.py` (install both
files together, same directory); this file only resolves the watch roots,
compares snapshots to the baseline, composes the advisory, and orders delivery
before baseline advance. Design record:
`evidence/reviews/2026-07-25-skill-vetting-snapshot-threat-model.md`.

Signature scanning is not a security boundary and has been removed. The hook
detects complete skill-tree changes and requires full skill vetting against the
exact content snapshot before trust or reuse of a cached verdict. It does not
attempt to decide whether a skill is malicious — a regex over skill text has low
recall on fluent-prose / cross-file / split / indirect payloads and would only
create false assurance (and, by echoing skill text, an injection surface). The
real defense is the `skill-vetting` skill: a full, human-grade read. This hook
only routes to it.

What fires an advisory (each covers EVERY file in the tree, not just SKILL.md):
a new, changed, or removed top-level DIRECTORY, symlink or special file under a
watched skills root — a top-level regular FILE is deliberately not a candidate,
because a loose `.md` beside the skill directories is not loadable as a skill; any
observation anomaly — an unreadable file or directory, an oversize file, a
budget breach (every candidate enumerated after it then advises too; a walkable
DIRECTORY among them is `partial` and its baseline write is skipped, while a
symlink or special file is a complete observation and IS baselined), ANY symlink, a special file (FIFO/socket/device), a hostile or
undecodable TOP-LEVEL candidate name (shown only as an opaque id; NESTED names
are deliberately not gated, since they are never echoed and their bytes are
already bound into the digest); an unreadable/corrupt/stale baseline. An anomalous tree can never be certified unchanged, so it re-advises
EVERY session until the anomaly is resolved — deliberate for a tree that cannot
be fully observed. A clean, unchanged tree is SILENT, and so is a first run
that found nothing to baseline; a first run that HAS something to baseline
emits one labelled bootstrap line naming that count. The line is emitted BEFORE
the store and says so ("are being baselined"): under G5 the advisory is a single
JSON object, so nothing can correct it afterwards. A store that then fails is
NOT announced separately - it cannot be, once a line has been printed - and does
not need to be: nothing was written, so the next session sees the same state and
says the same thing again. The hook NEVER blocks and NEVER emits a "safe" line.

Watched roots: `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/skills` (default `~/.claude/skills`) and
`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/skills` (falling back to the hook payload's `cwd`,
then the process cwd). Baseline: `<config>/skill-vetting/baseline.json`,
schema- and policy-versioned; a version change resets it VISIBLY.

Ordering guarantee: the advisory is printed FIRST and the baseline advances
only after that print succeeds — a failed delivery (or a refused/failed
baseline write) leaves the old baseline, so the same deltas re-advise next
session. Fail directions (both hold, they are not in tension):
- Robustness = the hook never breaks session start: it always exits 0, and an
  unexpected internal error emits a LABELLED degraded advisory ("changes may
  be unobserved") when nothing was printed yet — degraded visibly, not silent.
- Detection = FAIL CLOSED: whatever cannot be fully observed advises; nothing
  is silently baselined as clean.

Known limits (documented, not hidden):
- The baseline is NOT tamper-evident: it, the skills, and this hook share one
  trust level, and same-privilege local code can rewrite any of them. The
  advisory posture is a tripwire against upstream/content changes, not a
  defense against code already running as you.
- First run (no baseline file) baselines the installed skills it could snapshot
  WITHOUT reviewing them, and emits ONE line saying so with that count. The line
  is emitted BEFORE the write and is worded that way on purpose: G5 makes the
  advisory a single JSON object, so a store that then fails cannot be corrected
  afterwards and is not announced separately. It does not need to be - nothing
  was written, so the next session sees the same state and says the same thing
  again. "Snapshot" is wider than "observe": the count ALSO includes candidates
  whose observation was complete but adverse - an unreadable directory, a
  symlink, a special file, a hostile name - because for each of those the scan
  established everything it could about THAT candidate, so recording it is
  meaningful. What it EXCLUDES is a candidate lost to a resource-budget
  short-circuit, whose digest would describe the state of the RUN rather than
  the tree; recording that would make a later real observation compare equal to
  a placeholder. Every excluded candidate still advises through its own anomaly
  line, so nothing in the count, and nothing left out of it, is trusted
  silently. So a first run over EMPTY or
  missing skills roots is fully silent - there is nothing recorded without
  review, hence nothing to announce - and a first run in which candidates
  existed but none was observable emits their anomaly lines and no count line.
  What round 6 removed was the case that mattered: a bootstrap that RECORDED
  skills while saying nothing, which was reachable a second time after a failed
  first write and then swallowed a change. A run that records nothing cannot
  swallow anything, so its silence is not that defect. Run the
  `skill-vetting` skill on anything present but not yet reviewed;
  `skill_snapshot.py status` lists entries never recorded as vetted.
- A delivered advisory is not re-raised once baselined (advisory posture): the
  skill's §3 verdict binding, not this hook, carries the re-vet duty. The
  baseline records per-skill status (baseline/seen/vetted; `record` flips to
  vetted) for on-demand audit.
- SessionStart only: a skill installed after the scan is seen next session,
  and plugin-managed skills (e.g. under a plugin cache) are outside the
  watched roots — vet those manually.

Ships UNREGISTERED (per-user opt-in; the plugin registers no hooks by design) —
see the README hooks section for manual wiring. Python 3.8+, stdlib only. The
demoted signature patterns are NOT here by design: they live privately as
regression fixtures for the skill-vetting skill, never as a runtime detector.
