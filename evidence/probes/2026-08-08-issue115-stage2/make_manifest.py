"""Generate MANIFEST.json + MANIFEST.sha256 for the Issue-115 STAGE-2
package. Deterministic; re-run to re-derive. Read-only over artifact
files; writes only the two manifest outputs.

Package version model (RUNBOOK 3): a package version is immutable
once owner-approved. This script regenerates a manifest only while
the current package id is UNapproved; authoring a new version means
changing PACKAGE_ID here (plus a fresh OWNER-APPROVAL.json receipt),
never mutating an approved manifest in place. There is no amendment
chain and no --amend mode."""
